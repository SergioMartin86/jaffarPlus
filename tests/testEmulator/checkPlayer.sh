# Thorough exercise of the jaffar-player reproduction tool in unattended/headless mode. The player is
# interactive, but its batch flags (--reproduce --disableRender --unattended --exitOnEnd, plus the new
# --printFinalState oracle and --runCommand) make the main paths machine-checkable:
#   1. Headless reproduction reaches the expected final state (Win) and reports a stable final hash.
#   2. Determinism: the same config+solution reproduces to the identical final hash on a second run.
#   3. A partial (non-winning) solution reports a different, non-Win final state.
#   4. A solution containing a not-allowed input is detected and reported.
#   5. --runCommand q exits cleanly (return code 0).
#   6. --runCommand s writes a quicksave state file.
