# Tests the hash-database deduplication logic on the GridWalker maze (optimal solution = 8 moves):
#   1. Disabled  : with the hash DB off there is no deduplication at all, yet BFS must still find
#                  the optimal solution -- i.e. dedup is a performance aid, not a correctness crutch.
#   2. Rolling   : with a deliberately tiny store size the sliding window fills and rolls (older
#                  hash stores are aged out and dropped), forcing states to be re-explored. The
#                  search must still find the optimal solution, and the run must show the window
#                  actually rolled (a hash store with id > 0) and that collisions were detected.
