/**
 * @file inputHistory.hpp
 * @brief Abstract interface for how a search remembers the sequence of inputs ("path") that produced
 *        each state. The rest of JaffarPlus only ever talks to this base class; concrete strategies
 *        (none / raw bit-packed / shared prefix trie) live in their own headers and are selected from
 *        the .jaffar config. See inputHistoryFactory.hpp for construction.
 *
 * Two groups of operations live on this one interface:
 *  - per-runner "cursor" ops (pushInput, (de)serialize, toString): each Runner owns an instance and
 *    advances it as it explores.
 *  - "manager" ops on stored cold-slot bytes (initColdSlot, releaseColdSlot, captureColdToFull, sizes):
 *    these only use the shared backing (e.g. the trie), so the StateDb calls them on a reference instance.
 *
 * Cold vs full: the StateDb stores a compact "cold" representation in each state slot; standalone
 * snapshot buffers (best/worst/win, player initial state) hold a self-contained "full" representation.
 * For raw/none the two coincide; for the trie the cold form is a 4-byte node id while the full form is a
 * reconstructed, self-contained copy.
